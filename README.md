# Non-Gaussian Surface Simulations

**Author:** Sebastian Korsak

The method we followed is described on the paper: *Numerical Simulation of 3D Rough Surfaces and Analysis
of Interfacial Contact Characteristics*, by Guoqing Yang, Baotong Li, Yang Wang and Jun Hong. Here we have some of the steps as are writen in this paper.
